## What Is an "Rss Feed"?
Fundamentally, RSS is simply an XML text file. It's created by a website publisher and contains a running list of articles or other content published by the site, with the newest entry always at the top of the list. Each entry contains details like the article's title, description, and link to the content.

RSS feeds are published and updated in real time, so if you subscribe to a site's RSS feed, you'll always have access to the newest published content. That can be handy for news sites and podcasts that are frequently updated.
